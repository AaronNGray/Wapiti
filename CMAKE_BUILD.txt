CMake can be used to build a JNI interface for Wapiti and a static Wapiti library for your environment of choice, for instance for unix:

1. cd <wapiti_root> 
2. mkdir build; cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. In the build folder there will be a library libwapiti.so or libwapiti.dylib (mac os x)

Or on Darwin/mac os architecture, the library is already portable (no shared libraries needed):
> otool -L libwapiti.dylib

For linux, the library will contain dynamic dependencies, which can be checked on Linux by the command:
> ldd libwapiti.so

For portability of the JNI, the libwapiti.so should be shipped with these dependencies in the same directory (the local linking is prioritize). 

In the subdirection build/, execute the provided script to collect the dependencies:
> ../collect-dependencies.sh libwapiti.so .

The script will copy the required libaries together with libwapiti.so.

The jar file can we found under src/swig.

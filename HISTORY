  Release v?.?.?: Mainly multi-threading improvements

    RPROP algorithm is now fully multi-threaded.
    Error rate estimation during training is now multi-threaded.
    Better jobs scheduling in multi-threaded gradient.
    Multi-threading code can be disabled (compilation on Windows should be simpler).

  Release v1.1.0: A few new features

    Added maxent mode.
    Added decoding through posteriors, this should improve accuracy
      at the price of computational time.
    Added the RPROP optimization algorithm.
    Added absolute indexing in patterns.
    Changed the scored output format as the posterior decoding
      provide normalized score at each position. The output is now
      compatible with CRF++.
      Some code cleanup.

 * Error handling and memory managment
 *   Wapiti use a very simple system for error handling: violently fail. Errors
 *   can occurs in two cases, when user feed Wapiti with bad datas or when there
 *   is a problem on the system side. In both cases, there is nothing we can do,
 *   so the best thing is to exit with a meaning full error message.
 *
 *   Memory allocation is one of the possible point of failure and its painfull
 *   to always remeber to check return value of malloc so we provide wrapper
 *   around it and realloc who check and fail in case of error.
